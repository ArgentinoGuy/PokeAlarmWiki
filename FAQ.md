## General Info

#### What scanners are supported?

* Currently RocketMap and Monocole are compatible with PA. Any others following our [Webhook Standards](webhook-standard) should work as well. The PA team does NOT help with troubleshooting scanners - they have their own resources you can use.

#### I have a great idea for a new feature!
* Open an Enhancement Request on our Github page. Use the correct template - Do NOT post requests in Discord!

#### Do you support new services?
* Please check in the [New/Upcoming Service MEGA-THREAD](https://github.com/kvangent/PokeAlarm/issues/147) to see if the service has already been requested. If it hasn't, feel free to leave a post requesting it.

##Troubleshooting

#### I am receiving an Error from RocketMap! What do I do?
* Check the [RocketMap Wiki](https://rocketmap.readthedocs.io) or the ask in the RocketMap Discord.  We will not troubleshoot your RocketMap installation.

#### PokeAlarm outputs an alarm about 'ValueError' when starting up?

1. Make sure you didn't open any files with Notepad or TextEdit - they can break the encoding on your files.
2. If you sure that isn't the problem, then you probably have an error with your JSON Formatting. Look up how JSON formatting works and use a [JSON Editor](http://www.jsoneditoronline.org/) to find your problem.

#### My maps in discord or other services only work once in a while. What can I do?
* Make sure you have added a [Google API Key](Google-Maps-API-Key) and have the Static Maps API enabled. If you already have it enabled, make sure that you haven't hit the limit for free users.

#### I have some other problem and can't figure it out.
* If you have already checked the [Wiki](Home) thoroughly, you can try asking in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/S2BKC7p). Make sure to read the Rules before posting.
* **Note**: Only [PokeAlarm Patrons](https://www.patreon.com/pokealarm) are guaranteed responses from the PA team as thanks for their helping to keep PA alive and running.
